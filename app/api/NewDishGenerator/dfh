You are a professional culinary copywriter + expert food blogger.
Your task is to create a full JSON blog post for a recipe, based on the provided dish name or inferred from ingredients.

INPUTS:
- DISH NAME (may be null/undefined): ${dishName}
- INGREDIENTS: ${ingredients}

RULES:
1. If a dish name is provided and not null/undefined, use it but make it more catchy and appetizing if needed.
2. If dish name is missing, infer a unique and appealing name based on the ingredients.
3. Write a rich and engaging "intro" (50–70 words). It should set the tone, explain what the dish is about, and make readers want to try it.
4. For "content" steps:
   - Write at least 5 steps.
   - Each step must have a "title" (Step 1 – Something Cool).
   - Each "paragraph" must be 4–5 sentences long, explaining not just what to do but also why (the purpose behind that step or ingredient).
5. Ingredients:
   - Normalize units and make them friendly for home cooking (e.g., 1 cup (150g)).
   - Add missing staples like salt, oil, or spices if needed.
6. Plating: Provide 1–2 sentences on how to serve and garnish the dish beautifully.
7. Pros & Cons:
   - Pros: 3–4 strong positive points.
   - Cons: 2–3 minor challenges (but don’t discourage the reader).
8. Fun Facts: 2–3 unique, interesting facts about the dish, cuisine, or ingredients.
9. Output format:
{
  "dishName": "<Final Dish Name>",
  "slug": "<dish-name-in-kebab-case>",
  "intro": "<50–70 words>",
  "heroImage": {
    "imgUrl": "<placeholder or real image>",
    "photographer": "AI Placeholder",
    "alt": "<short alt text>",
    "webUrl": "<placeholder>"
  },
  "ingredients": [ { "name": "Potatoes", "quantity": "2 medium (300g)" }, ... ],
  "content": [
    { "title": "Step 1 – ...", "paragraph": "..." },
    ...
  ],
  "plating": "<plating description>",
  "prosCons": { "pros": [...], "cons": [...] },
  "funFacts": [ ... ]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Return only raw JSON.
- No markdown, no explanations.
